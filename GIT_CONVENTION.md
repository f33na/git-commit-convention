# Git Commit Convention Standard

> Standard version: 1.0.0

## Commit Format

```
[TASK-ID/TAG] Short description of the change
```

| Part | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TASK-ID` | Optional | Task identifier (matches the branch name) |
| `TAG` | Required | Change type tag (see table below) |
| Description | Required | Short description in the project language, up to 72 characters |

---

## Usage Modes

### Full format — task and branch exist

Used when work is done in a dedicated branch tied to a task.  
The branch name matches the `TASK-ID`.

```
[TASK-ID/TAG] Description
```

```bash
# Examples
[AUTH-42/FEATURE] Add OAuth2 authorization via Google
[PAY-7/FIX] Fix amount rounding on currency conversion
[API-15/MAJOR] Change response structure of /users endpoint
[UI-3/REFACTOR] Extract buttons into a separate Button component
```

---

### Short format — no task or small project

Used when:
- The project is small and tasks are not formalized
- No issue tracking system is in place
- Single developer
- Commit goes directly to `main` or `dev`

```
[TAG] Description
```

```bash
# Examples
[INIT] Initialize project
[FEATURE] Add dark theme
[FIX] Remove memory leak in WebSocket handler
[CHORE] Update dependencies
[RELEASE] v1.3.0
```

---

## Change Tags

| Tag | Description | Version impact |
|---|---|---|
| `INIT` | Project or module initialization | — |
| `FEATURE` | New functionality | **MINOR** ↑ |
| `FIX` | Bug fix | **PATCH** ↑ |
| `HOTFIX` | Urgent fix on production | **PATCH** ↑ |
| `MAJOR` | Breaking change, API incompatibility | **MAJOR** ↑ |
| `REFACTOR` | Refactoring without behavior change | **PATCH** ↑ |
| `PERF` | Performance improvement | **PATCH** / **MINOR** ↑ |
| `STYLE` | Formatting, linting, indentation | — |
| `DOCS` | Documentation | — |
| `TEST` | Adding or updating tests | — |
| `CHORE` | Routine: dependencies, configs, CI/CD | — |
| `REVERT` | Reverting a previous commit | **PATCH** ↑ |
| `RELEASE` | Release commit, version bump | — |

## Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

Version format: **`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`**

| Level | When it increments |
|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | Breaking changes (`MAJOR`) |
| **MINOR** | New functionality (`FEATURE`, `PERF` for significant improvement) |
| **PATCH** | Fixes and minor changes (`FIX`, `HOTFIX`, `REFACTOR`, `REVERT`, `PERF`) |
| **—** | No version change (`STYLE`, `DOCS`, `TEST`, `CHORE`, `INIT`, `RELEASE`) |

### Rule for determining the next version

Look at all commits since the last `RELEASE`:

```
At least one MAJOR?            → MAJOR++,  MINOR = 0, PATCH = 0
At least one FEATURE / PERF*? → MINOR++,  PATCH = 0
Everything else (FIX, HOTFIX…)? → PATCH++
Only STYLE / DOCS / TEST / CHORE → no version change
```

> *`PERF` bumps `MINOR` only if the change is significant for the end user.

## Release Commit and Git Tag

```bash
# Release marker commit
git commit --allow-empty -m "[RELEASE] v1.3.0"

# Git tag
git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "Release v1.3.0"
git push origin v1.3.0
```

---

## Description Formatting Rules

- Length — no more than **72 characters**
- Use the **imperative mood**: *Add*, *Fix*, *Remove*, *Update*
- Do not end with a period
- Write in the language agreed upon by the team (defined in this file)
- If more context is needed — add a commit body after a blank line:

```
[AUTH-42/FEATURE] Add OAuth2 authorization via Google

Implemented authorization via Google OAuth2.
Added environment variables GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET.
Affected modules: auth, config, middleware.
```

---

## Branch Naming

The branch name must match the `TASK-ID` in the commit.

```
AUTH-42     ← branch for task AUTH-42
PAY-7       ← branch for task PAY-7
```

Permanent branches (`main`, `dev`) have no `TASK-ID` — use the short commit format for them.

---

## Quick Reference

```
Has branch / task?
  YES →  [TASK-ID/TAG] Description
  NO  →  [TAG] Description

Does TAG affect the version?
  MAJOR   → x+1.0.0
  FEATURE → x.y+1.0
  FIX     → x.y.z+1
  others  → no change
```
