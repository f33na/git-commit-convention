# 📋 Git Commit Convention

> A lightweight, practical standard for commit messages and semantic versioning — works for solo developers and teams alike.

## Why this standard?

Most commit conventions (like Conventional Commits) are designed for large teams with CI/CD pipelines and automated changelogs. This standard is different:

- ✅ Works for **solo developers** on small projects
- ✅ Works for **teams** with a task tracker and branches
- ✅ Stays **readable** in `git log` without extra tooling
- ✅ Maps directly to **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**

## Commit Format

```
[TASK-ID/TAG] Short description of the change
```

### Two modes

**Full format** — when you have a task and a dedicated branch:

```
[AUTH-42/FEATURE] Add OAuth2 authorization via Google
[PAY-7/FIX] Fix amount rounding on currency conversion
[API-15/MAJOR] Change response structure of /users endpoint
```

**Short format** — solo project, no tracker, committing to `main`/`dev`:

```
[INIT] Initialize project
[FEATURE] Add dark theme
[FIX] Remove memory leak in WebSocket handler
[RELEASE] v1.3.0
```

> The branch name always matches `TASK-ID`.

## Semantic Versioning

Version format: **`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`**

Look at all commits since the last `RELEASE` tag and apply the first matching rule:

```
Any MAJOR?              →  MAJOR++,  MINOR = 0, PATCH = 0
Any FEATURE or PERF*?  →  MINOR++,  PATCH = 0
Any FIX / HOTFIX / …?  →  PATCH++
Only STYLE/DOCS/CHORE  →  no change
```

> `*` `PERF` bumps `MINOR` only when the improvement is significant to the end user.

---

## Release Flow

```bash
# 1. Finish all work, then mark the release
git commit --allow-empty -m "[RELEASE] v1.3.0"

# 2. Create an annotated tag
git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "Release v1.3.0"

# 3. Push with tags
git push origin main --tags
```

## Writing Good Descriptions

- Max **72 characters**
- Use **imperative mood**: _Add_, _Fix_, _Remove_, _Update_
- No period at the end
- Add a body after a blank line when context is needed:

```
[AUTH-42/FEATURE] Add OAuth2 authorization via Google

Implemented authorization via Google OAuth2.
Added environment variables GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET.
Affected modules: auth, config, middleware.
```

---

## Quick Reference Card

```
Has a branch / task?
  YES →  [TASK-ID/TAG] Description
  NO  →  [TAG] Description

Does the TAG affect the version?
  MAJOR    →  x+1.0.0
  FEATURE  →  x.y+1.0
  FIX      →  x.y.z+1
  others   →  no change
```
